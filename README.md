## Assignment

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://url-shortener-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks. Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

Clone this GitHub repo and complete your project locally.
Use our Replit starter project to complete your project.
Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.
If you use Replit, follow these steps to set up the project:

Start by importing the project on Replit.
Next, you will see a .replit window.
Select Use run command and click the Done button.

HINT: Do not forget to use a body parsing middleware to handle the POST requests. Also, you can use the function dns.lookup(host, cb) from the dns core module to verify a submitted URL.

## Submitting

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.
